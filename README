::: Album :::
-------------
Album is a snapshot manager for the btrfs filesystem. 
You can use it to create snapshots of your system.
You will next be able to boot into a snapshot from the grub boot menu.
When you boot into a snapshot, album is able to roll back your main 
system state into the snapshot state.


Requirements
-------------
* a separate boot partition
* a separate home partiton ( or subvolume)
* a btrfs partition with the main system installed in a subvolume named 
  "manjaro_i686" or "manjaro_x86_64" depending on your architecture
* packages: btrfs-progs, grub-common, python


Installation
------------
-copy the file "11_btrfs-snapshots" in /etc/grub.d/
-use the file "update-grub" as a replacement of your current /usr/sbin/update-grub
-copy other file where you want but in th same folder (I will change this after whith
  creating a pkgbuild) 
-run with /path/to/album
